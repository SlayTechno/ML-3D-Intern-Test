# Task Selection

Choose one of the following tasks to demonstrate your AR/ML engineering skills. Each task is designed to showcase different aspects of 3D augmented reality and machine learning.

**Both tasks SHOULD include the following:**

1. Create a wireframe or rough sketch of the interface layout using any tool you're comfortable with (e.g., Figma, draw.io, or even pen and paper).
2. Use any modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Svelte, Vue, &c) for UI development. Svelte/SvelteKit is preferred but not mandatory. Plain ol' HTML/CSS/JS is also acceptable.
3. Both tasks will require you to create your own ML model to work against.

**Choose ONE of the following tasks to complete:**

### 3D AR

Design and implement a UI that enables the end user to select from at least two different 3D head coverings to wear virtually, using the ML model you trained to fit the end user's head.

### Machine Learning

Design and implement a UI that enables the end user to select from at least two different makeup styles (lipstick, eye shadow, or blush), using the ML model you trained to fit the end user's skin tone.

## Deliverables

- A GitHub repository containing your project
- Steps to be able to run the project
- A README.md file with:
  - A brief explanation of your design decisions and any assumptions made
  - Any additional features or improvements you would add given more time

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality and correctness of the implementation
- Code quality, organization, and best practices
- Effective use of the ML model
- User experience and interface usability (appropriate to the chosen option)
- Error handling and application reliability

## Time Allocation

- Basic interface sketch/wireframe: 1-2 hours
- Implementation: 8-10 hours
- Total estimated time: 9-12 hours

Choose the option that best aligns with your skills and interests. Please note that while we provide a time estimate, we understand that the actual completion time may vary. Focus on delivering a high-quality solution that showcases your skills in both design and development.
